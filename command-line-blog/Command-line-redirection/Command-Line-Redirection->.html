        <h1>(>) Command</h1>
        <p><strong>$ cat deserts.txt > forests.txt</strong></p>
        
        <p>(>) takes the standard output of the command on the left, and redirects it to the file on the right. <br>
        Here the standard output of $ cat deserts.txt is redirected to <strong>forests.txt</strong></p>
        <p>Keep in mind that (>) overwrites all original content in forests.txt. When you view the output data<br>
        by using (cat) on <strong>forests.txt</strong>, you will only see contents of <strong>deserts.txt</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h2>(>>)</h2>
        <p>Above we learned how to overwrite a files contents, but what if we want to add to a file <br>
        without losing the original text? We use the <strong>>> command!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>$ cat deserts.txt >> forests.txt</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Here the output data of forests.txt will contain its original content along with the content of <br>
        deserts.txt appended to it.</p>
        
        <!--
        <h2>grep command & grep -i option</h2>
        <p><storng>$ grep America continents.txt</storng></p>
        <p>grep stands for "global regular expression print" Its purpose is to search files for lines that match a <br>
        pattern and then return the results. <br>
        grep is case-sensitive. In the bolded commands above we use grep to search for anything that matched "America"<br>
        in <strong>continents.txt</strong>.</p>
