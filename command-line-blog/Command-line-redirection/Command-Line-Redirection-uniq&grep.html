        <h1>uniq & grep | commands</h1>
        <p><strong>$ uniq deserts.txt</strong></p>
        <p>uniq stands for "unique". It filters out adjacent, duplicate lines in a file. Here uniq deserts.txt filters out <br>
        duplicates of "sahara desert", because its duplicate directly follows the previous instance. The "kalahari desert" <br>
        duplicates are not adjacent and thus remain.</p>
        <p><strong>$ sort deserts.txt | uniq</strong></p>
        <p>A more effective way to use uniq is to call sort to alphabetize a file, and "pipe" the standard output to uniq. <br>
        By "piping" $ sort deserts.txt to uniq all duplicate lines are alphabetized and filtered out.</p>
        <p><strong>$ sort deserts.txt | uniq > uniq-deserts.txt</strong></p>
        <p>Here we simply send filtered contents to uniq-deserts.txt which you can view with the cat command.</p>

        <h2>grep command & grep -i option</h2>
        <p><storng>$ grep America continents.txt</storng></p>
        <p>grep stands for "global regular expression print" Its purpose is to search files for lines that match a <br>
        pattern and then return the results. <br>
        grep is case-sensitive. In the bolded commands above we use grep to search for anything that matched "America"<br>
        in <strong>continents.txt</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>$ grep -i America continents.txt</strong></p>
        <p>The -i option for grep allows the command to be case insensitive. Here, grep searched for capital of lowercase <br>
        strings that match "America" in the <strong>continents.txt</strong> file.</p>
       
        <br>
        
        <h2>grep II</h2>
        
        <p><strong>$ grep -R Arctic<br>
        /home/ccuser/workspace/geography<br>
        <br>
        /home/ccuser/workspace/geography/deserts.txt: Arctic Desert<br>
        /home/ccuser/workspace/geography/oceans.txt: Arctic Ocean
        </strong></p>
        <p>The grep -r option searches for all files in a directory and outputs filenames and lines containing all <br>
        matches results. The -r stands for "recursive"</p>
        <p>In the commands above grep -r searched the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography for the string "Arctic" and <br>
        outputted filenames and lines with matching results.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>$ grep -Rl Arctic<br>
        /home/ccuser/workspace/geography<br>
        <br>
        /home/ccuser/workspace/geography/deserts.txt<br>
        /home/ccuser/workspace/geography/oceans.txt
        </strong></p>
        <p>grep -Rl searches all files in a directory and outputs only filenames with matched results (no lines). Above, <br>
        grep -Rl searched the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography directory for the string "Arctic" and outputs filenames wi<br>
        -th matched results.</p>
