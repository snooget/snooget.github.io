        <h1>Command Line Redirection Intro</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Up until now I have been running commands in the comamnd line and have received a stream of <br>
        output in the terminal. In these next lessons I will focus on input/output (I/O) redirection.</p>
        
        <p>Through redirection I can direct the input and output of a command to and from other <br>
        files and programs. Which will allow me to chain commands together into a pipeline.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>$ echo "Hello" <br>
        Hello</strong></p>
        <p>The (echo) command accepts the string "Hello" as standard input, and echos the string <br>
        "Hello" back to the terminal as standard output.</p>
        <p>Let's learn more about standard input, standard output, and standard error:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>standard input</em>, abbreviated as (stdin), is information inputted into the <br>
            terminal through the keyboard or input device.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em>standard output</em>, abbreviated as (stdout), is the information outputted after <br>
            a process is run</li>
            <br>
            <li><em>standard error</em>, abbreviated as (stderr), is an error message outputted by a <br>
            failed process.</li>
            <br>
            <p>Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error to or from <br>
            a different location.</p>
        </ol>
