        <h1>Command Line Manipulation (mv)</h1>
        
        <h3>Mv</h3>

            <p>The (mv) command moves files. It's similar to (cp) in its usage. However, (mv) does not copy files.</p>
            <p>To move a file into a directory use (mv) with the source file as the first argument and the <br> 
            destination directory.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is a coded example:</p>
            <p><strong>$ mv my_file.txt my_directory/</strong></p>
            <p>To move multiple files into a directory it will be written out the same way <br>
            with a list of source files as the first arguments and the destination directory as the last argument.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here's an example of multiple files being moved:</p>
            <p><strong>$ mv my_file1.txt my_file2.txt my_directory/</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>We can also rename a file using the (mv) command. To rename a file use (mv) with the old file <br>
            as the first argument and the new file as the second argument. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Here's an example of renaming a file with the (mv) command</p>
            <p><strong>$ mv file_origin.txt file_renamed.txt</strong></p>
