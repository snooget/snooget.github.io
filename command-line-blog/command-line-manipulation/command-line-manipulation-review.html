        <h1>Command Line Manipulation Review Notes</h1>
        <h2>So far I have learned:</h2>
            <p>So far I have learned how to use the command line to view and manipulate the filesystem. <br>
            <br>Here is what can be generalized so far:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Options modify the behavior of commands</li>
                <br>
                <li>($ ls -a) Lists all contents of a directory including hidden files in that directory.</li>
                <li>($ ls -l) Lists all conent in long format.</li>
                <li>($ ls -t)  Orders files and directories by the date they were last modified.</li>
                <li>Multiple options can be used together, like ($ ls -alt).</li>
                <br>
                <li>From the command line you can also copy, move and remove files and directories.</li>
                <li>($ cp) Copies files.</li>
                <li>($ mv) Moves and renames files.</li>
                <li>($ rm) Removes files.</li>
                <li>($ rm -r) Removes directories</li>
                <br>
                <li>Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Quick Questions:</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>How would you delete a directory called music/?</strong></li>
                <p> Answer: $ rm -r music/ (Remember that -r deletes directories and child directories.</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>What command shows all files in the current directory in long format <br>
                including hidden files?</strong></li>
                <p>Answer: $ ls -al (-a option shows contents of a directory including ones that start with .. <br>
                which are typically hidden. However, the -l option will also show content in long format.</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Which option allows you to list files by when they were last modified?</strong></li>
                <p>Answer: $ ls -t (Shows files based on date last modified.</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Which command could you use to copy the contents of kendrick.txt <br>
                to a new file called rappers.txt?</strong></li>
                <p>Answer: $ cp kendrick.txt rappers.txt</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>How would you delete all files in the directory media/ (but not the directory itself)?</strong></li>
                <p>Answer: $ rm media/* (The rm command on its own cannot remove a directory, and the second <br>
                argument does not specify the files inside media/) </p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>What is the purpose of an option?</strong></li>
                <p>Answer: To modify the behavior of a command</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>What command moves all files in the current directory to the directory school/?</strong></li>
                <p>Answer: $ mv * school/ (mv takes the first argument * to mean all files in the current <br>
                directory, and moves them to the destination school/ specified by the second argument) </p>
            </ol>
