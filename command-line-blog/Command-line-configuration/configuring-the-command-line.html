        <h1>Configuring the Command Line Intro</h1>
        <h2>What's the point of the Command Line?</h2>
        <p>The comamnd line is a super useful tool for developing projects. The command line can be used to <br>
        manage all project files; you can move files, delete files, reorganize files, search & replace terms, <br>
        and so much more!!</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can also control the execution of programs you write and run from dev software.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As I become better at using some of the many programming languages and command line,<br>
        I will be able to have many things running at once. For example, I can execute a Python <br>
        project and keep track of output as the program runs, I can edit files directly inside <br>
        the command line, and I can run commands from development software like Git, to keep things<br>
        organized. As I become a better developer I will want to edit the command line environmenr to <br>
        my liking and convineince. </p>
