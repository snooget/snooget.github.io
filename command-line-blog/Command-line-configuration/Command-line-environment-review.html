        <h1>Environment Review</h1>
        <p>We just learned how to use the bash profile to configure our environment. What can we generalize so far?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The environment refers to the prefrences and settings of the current user.</li>
            <li>The nano editor is a command line text editor used to configure the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> is where environment settings are stored. This file can be edited<br>
            with nano.</li>
            <li><em>Environment</em> variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs to info<br>
            about the environment.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>$ export VARIABLE="Value"</strong> sets and exports an environment variable.</li>
                <li><strong>USER</strong> is the name of the current user.</li>
                <li><strong>PS1</strong> is the command prompt.</li>
                <li><strong>HOME</strong> is the home directory. It is usually not customized.</li>
                <li><strong>PATH</strong> returns a colon : seperated list of file points.</li>
                <li><strong>env</strong> returns a list of environmental variables. Output can be redirected using grep<br>
                to select the variable we would like to view.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
