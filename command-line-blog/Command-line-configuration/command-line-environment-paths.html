        <h1>Path Environment Variable</h1>
        <p>Path is a environment variable that stores a list of directories seperated by a colon.</p>
        <p>Typing <strong>$ echo $PATH</strong> will reveal a long list of directories seperated<br>
        by a colon.</p>
        <p>Each directory will contain scripts for the command line to execute. The <storng>PATH</storng>variable<br>
        will simply list which directories contain scripts.</p>
        <p>Many of the commands I have learned are stored in the <strong>/bin</strong> directory.</p>
        <p><strong>$ /bin/pwd</strong> is the script executed when typing the <strong>pwd</strong> command.</p>
        <p><strong>$ /bin/ls</strong> is the script executed when typing the ls command.</p>
        <h2>ENV</h2>
        <p>ENV stands for environment. </p>
