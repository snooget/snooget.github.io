        <h1>Intro to Environment</h1>
        <p>Each time we launch the terminal application, a new session is created.</p>
        <p>The session will load up settings and preferences that make the command-line environment.</p>
        <p>We are able to configure the command line to support the command and programs we create.</p>
        <p>Typing $ nano hello.txt activates the nano text editor. I can also use crtl + o to savea file <br>
        and use ctrl + x to exit nano.</p>
        <h3>Nano Continued</h3>
        <p>Here's how nano works:</p>
        <p><strong>$ nano hello.txt</strong></p>
        <p>Nano is a command line text editor. It works the same way as the notes app in most computers and<br>
        phones. The only difference is that it is accessable from the command line.<br>
        Let's walkthrough the previous above excercise I did for nano;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The command <strong>$ nano hello.txt</strong> opens a new text file named "hello.txt" in the<br>
            nano text editor.</li>
            <li><strong>"Hello, I am nano."</strong> is a text string entered into at the line indicated by the <br>
            cursor.</li>
            <li>The menu of keyboard commands at the bottom of the window allow us to save changes to "hello.txt"<br>
            and exit nano. The ^ stands for crtl key.</li>
            <li>^ + O will save a file. O stands for output. Again, not case sensitive.</li>
            <li>^ + X will exit the nano program. X stands for exit.</li>
            <li>^ + G will open the help menu.</li>
        </ul>
