        <h1><strong>git push</strong></h1>

        <p>When sharing work, using the push command will do the job. Here's how:</p>
        
        <p><strong>$ git push origin your_branch_name</strong></p>
        
        <p>The command above will push up your branch to the remote, origin. From there, your co-workers can review your branch<br>
        and merge your work into the main branch, making it part of the definitive project version.</p>
