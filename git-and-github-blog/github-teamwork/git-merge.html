        <h1><strong>git merge</strong></h1>
        
        <p>We will use <em>git merge</em> to integrate out origin/main branch into our local main branch.</p>

        <p>Below is the command:</p>

        <p><strong>$ git merge origin/main</strong></p>

        <h2><strong>Git Workflow</strong></h2>
        
        <p>Now that origin/master have been merged into the local master branch we are ready to contribute to some work on<br>
        our own. The workflow for Git typically follows this order:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Fetch and merge changes from the remote.</li>
            <li>Create a branch to work on a new project feature.</li>
            <li>Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work.</li>
            <li>Fetch and merge from the remote agin (in case new commits where made while you where working.</li>
            <li>Push your branch up to the remote for view.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Steps 1 and 4 are safegaurds against merge conflicts. Step 5 involves a git push command which will be learned next.</p>
