        <p>Sometimes you may need to look back at a cloned repository to check if someone had made any previous changes. An easy<br>
        way to check if previous changes have been made is to type the following command:</p>
        
        <p><strong>$ git fetch</strong></p>
       
        <p>The above command will not merge changes from the remote to local repositories, but will bring these changes in to the<br>
        remote branch.</p>
