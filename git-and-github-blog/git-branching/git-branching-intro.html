        <h1><strong>git Branching Intro</strong></h1>
        <p>Most of the work I have done for git has been on a single branch.<br>
        I will learn how to switch from main to other branches with git commands.</p>
        <p>git allows us to create seperate branches in order to experiment with code<br>
        and create different versions of a project.</p>
        <p>To check the current branch type:</p>
        <p><strong>$ git branch</strong></p>
        
        <h2><strong>git Branching II</strong></h2>
        <p>Many projects will have a master commonly called main branch. To create a<br>
        new branch, use:</p>
        <p><strong>$ git branch new_branch</strong></p>
        <p>The words "new_branch" will be something that describes the purpose of the<br>
        branch. Remember that branch names can't contain whitespace.</p>

        <h2><strong>$ git Checkout</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>$ git checkout branch_name</strong></p>
        <p>The command above allows you to switch branches and make new edits under the<br>
        selected branch.</p>

        <p>When switching branches you are able to do all commands that you where able to<br>
        previously do in the main branch.</p>

        <h2><strong>$ git merge</strong></h2>
        <p>Once you are satisfied with the edits on the other branch you can then merge the<br>
        content from the named branch to the main branch.</p>
        <p>This is accomplished by typing:</p>
        <p><strong>$ git merge branch_name</strong></p>

        <h2><strong>merge conflict I</strong></h2>
        <p>Merge conflicts occur for a few reasons, here is one: Imagine you made commits on<br>
        the main branch before merging the secondary branch. Additionally, what if you made a<br>
        commit on main that alters the same exact text you worked on in the secondary branch. This<br>
        is how merge conflicts emerge. Here's how to solve them:</p>
        <p>A merge error will appear when you do as described above. To fix it you will refresh the<br>
        text editor and see two versions of the edit. You can select which one you prefer then create<br>
        a new commit, and viola! Problem solved!</p>

        <h2><strong>delete branch</strong></h2>
        <p>git branches are a means to an end and are meant to be merged into the main branch.<br>
        The command:</p>
        <p><strong>$ git branch -d branch_name</strong></p>
        <p>is used to delete a branch once it has been merged.</p>
