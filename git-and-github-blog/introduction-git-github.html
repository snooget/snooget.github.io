        <h1>Introduction: Git & GitHub</h1>
        <p>I will practice using basic Git commands in the terminal to add version control to my projects. This will allow me to<br>
        switch between different versions of my project. Git is super useful for creating new features for a project while keeping<br>
        an extra copy of the old version.</p>
        <p>In a few more pages I will go over how to integrate Git with GitHub, which is one of the most used web applications<br>
        by developers across the world to collaborate on projects and share code!</p>
        <p>By the end of this project I will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a Git project & setup a remote copy on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Label code changes and move between different versions of the project.</li>
            <li>Write text on the GitHub interface using <em>markdowns</em> to describe project & code changes.</li>
            <li>Create branches in your Git project so you can collaborate with others.</li>
            <li>Use Git commands to make sure your local copy of code matches the remote copy on Github.</li>
            <li>Use GitHub pull requests to discuss code with others.</li>
            <li>Be familiar with Git rebase, Git repository settings, and how to keep a remote repository organized.</li>
            <li>How to create a GitHub profile and explore code written by others.</li>
            <li>Be familiar with GitHub features that allow you to manage tasks within GitHub itself and automate actions.</li>
        </ul>
