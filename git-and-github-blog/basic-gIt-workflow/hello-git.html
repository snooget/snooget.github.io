        <h1><strong>Hello Git | Git init | Git Workflow</strong></h1>
        <p>Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes to a project over time. Git works by recording changes <br>
        then storing them to become accessable for future reference or use.</p>

        <h2><strong>Git init</strong></h2>
        <p>The word init means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to a <br>
        project.</p>
        
        <div></div>
       
        <h2><strong>Git Workflow</strong></h2>
        <p>Once we "git init" we have started our Git project! A git project can be divided into three parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A working directory: Where you'll be doing all the work. Creating, editing, deleting, and organizing files.</li>
            <li><em>A staging area</em>: Where you'll list changes you make to the working directory.</li>
            <li><em>A repository</em>: Where Git permanantly stores thoes changes as different versions of the project.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The git workflow consist of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving <br>
        changes in the repository. In Git we save changes with a <em>commit</em>, which will be covered below.</p>
