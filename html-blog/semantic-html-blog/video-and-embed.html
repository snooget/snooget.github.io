                    <p>
                    As demonstrated in the previous slide, media content can be a useful addition to a website. By using a <strong>video</strong> element, we can add videos to our website.
                    The <strong>video</strong> element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user. Here are three big attributes that affect the video's playback:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>controls</strong>: When added in, a play and pause button will be added in the video. A volume control and fullscreen option are also avaliable with this attribute.</li>
                        <li><strong>autoplay</strong>: This attribute results in the video automatically being played.</li>
                        <li><strong>loop</strong>: This attribute will result in the video being payed on repeat.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is an examlpe of the <strong>video</strong> element being used with the controls attribute:</p>

                    <p>
                    In the code above a file named <em>coding.mp4</em> is being played. The "video not supported" text will only show if a browser can not load the video. Another tag that can be used
                    to incorporate media on a webpage is the <strong>embed</strong> tag, which can embed any media files from souces such as audio foles, videos, and gifs. This means that websites that
                    have an embed button have some form of media content thatc can be added to other websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <strong>"embed"</strong> tag is a self-closing tag unlike the <strong>video</strong> element. Note that <strong>"embed"</strong> is a depreciated tag and other alternatives should be used.
                    such as <strong>video, audio,</strong> and <strong>img</strong>.</p>
