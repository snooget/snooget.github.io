                    As demonstrated in the previous slide, media content can be a useful addition to a website. By using a <strong>video</strong> element, we can add videos to our website.
                    The <strong>video</strong> element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user. Here are three big attributes that affect the video's playback:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>controls</strong>: When added in, a play and pause button will be added in the video. A volume control and fullscreen option are also avaliable with this attribute.</li>
                        <li><strong>autoplay</strong>: This attribute results in the video automatically being played.</li>
                        <li><strong>loop</strong>: This attribute will result in the video being payed on repeat.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is an examlpe of the <strong>video</strong> element being used with the controls attribute:</p>
