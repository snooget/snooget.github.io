        <h1>Header & Nav</h1>
        <p>Here we will look into some semantic elements that assist in the structure of a web page. A <strong>header</strong><br>
        is a container for navigational links or introductory content containing <strong>h1</strong> to <strong>h6</strong><br>
        headings.</p>
        <p>Looking at the image below will reveal the <strong>header</strong> in action.</p>
        <img src="/Users/snooget/snooget-web-dev/images-snooget/semantic-html-header-and-nav.png"/>
        <p>The code above can be compared to the code below which uses <strong>div</strong> tags instead of <strong>header</strong><br>
        tags.</p>

        <p>By using a <strong>header</strong> tag, our code becomes easier to read. It becomes much easier to identify what's in<br>
        the <strong>h1's</strong> parent tags, as opposed to the <strong>div</strong> tag which lacks in detail.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Looking at the <strong>nav</strong> tag, we can define blocks of navigation links such as menus and table of contents.<br>
        It is important to remember <strong>nav</strong> can be used inside of the <strong>header</strong> element and on its own.</p>
        <p>Take a look at this example below!</p>

        <p>By using <strong>nav</strong> to label the navigation links it becomes easy for us, web browsers, and screen readers<br>
        to read the website. This makes for better SEO and higher webpage rankings.</p>
        <p>It is time to add <strong>header & nav</strong> into our html code!</p>
