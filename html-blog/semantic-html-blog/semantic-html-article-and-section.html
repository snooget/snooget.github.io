                <p>Now that we have covered the head of semantic html, lets go over what happens in the body.<br>
                The two elements we will focus on in this page are <strong>section</strong> and<strong> article.</strong><br></p>
                <p>Section defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any area of the document with the<br>
                same theme. For example, articles covering the sport cricket could go under a single <strong>section</strong><br>
                while a websites homepage could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of how to use section:</p>

                <p>In the code above we created a section element to encapsulate the code. In <strong>section</strong> we added<br>
                a <strong>h2</strong> element as a heading.</p>
            </article>
            </section>

            <section>
            <article>
                <p>The <strong>article</strong> element holds content that makes sense on its own.<strong>Article</strong><br>
                can hold content such as articles, blogs, commands, magazines, and more. An article tag would help someone with<br>
                a screen reader understand where an article begins and ends. Below is an example of <strong>article</strong> in action:</p>
