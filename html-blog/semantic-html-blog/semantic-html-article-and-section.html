                <p>Now that we have covered the head of semantic html, lets go over what happens in the body.<br>
                The two elements we will focus on in this page are <strong>section</strong> and<strong> article.</strong><br></p>
                <p>Section defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any area of the document with the<br>
                same theme. For example, articles covering the sport cricket could go under a single <strong>section</strong><br>
                while a websites homepage could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of how to use section:</p>
