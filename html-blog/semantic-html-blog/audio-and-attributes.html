                    <h2>Audio & Attributes</h2>
                    <p>Now that we have learned about text based content, lets learn about <strong>audio</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Every now and then you may want to add audio to your websites. Luckily, with the <strong>"audio"</strong>
                    element, you are able to embed audio content! Much like <strong>"video"</strong><strong> "audio"</strong><br>
                    will also use a "src" to find the file.</p>
                    <p>Here is audio in action:</p>
                    <img src="/Users/snooget/snooget-web-dev/images-snooget/audio-element-in-action.png">
                    <p>In the code above, we created an <strong>"audio"</strong> element. Then created a <strong>"source"</strong><br>
                    element to encapsulate our audio link. The audio file is what comes after the =. We also use "type" and named the<br>
                    type of audio it is. Using "type" is not nessecary but helps the browser identify if the file is supported.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Above, we linked our audio file to the browser but it is missing a few controls. Here's how we would add controls.</p>
                    <p><em>Attributes</em>. Attributes allow for us to many different things to our files. We will focus on the "controls"<br>
                    and "src" attributes for now.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Controls</em>: Automatically displays the audio controls in the web browsers, such as play and mute.</li>
                        <li><em>src</em>: Specifies the URL of the audio file.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As you can probally tell. We have used the <em>src</em> attribute in the code above. Also remember that most attributes<br>
                    will go in the opening tag. Below is an example of adding autoplay and audio controls.</p>
