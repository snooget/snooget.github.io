        <h1>Main & Footer</h1>
        <p>Two more structural elements are <strong>"main & footer"</strong>. These elements along with <strong>"nav" and "header"</strong><br>
        help describe where an element is located based on conventional web development standards.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The element<strong>"main"</strong> is used to encapsulate dominant content within a webpage. This tag is seperate<br>
        from the <strong>"footer"</strong> and the <strong>"nav"</strong> of a webpage since these elements don't contain the <br>
        principal content.</p>
        <p>By using <strong>"main"</strong> instead of <strong>"div"</strong> screen readers and website crawlers are able to easily<br>
        identify what content is inside of the tags.</p>
        <P>How does <strong>"main"</strong> look when incorporated into our code?</P>
        <p><strong>Look at the source code below:</strong></p>
        <main>
            <header>
              <h1>Types of Sports</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
              <h3>Baseball</h3>
              <p>
                The first game of baseball was played in Cooperstown, New York in the summer of 1839.
              </p>
            </article>
          </main>
        <p>If we look into the source code above, we can see <strong>"main"</strong> contains an <strong>"article"</strong><br>
        and <strong>"header"</strong> tag with child elements that hold the most important info related to the page.</p>
        <p>The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the <strong>"footer"</strong> indicated by the <br>
        footer element. The <strong>footer</strong> contains info such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact information</li>
            <li>Copyright information</li>
            <li>Terms of use</li>
            <li>Site map</li>
            <li>Reference to top of page links</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example: (Check the source code)</p>        
        <footer>
            <p>Email me at arthur@snooget.com</p>
        </footer>
