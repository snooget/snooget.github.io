                    <p>Incorporating semantic html into websites is a great way to make them accessible and easier to read.</p>
                    <p>Below are some of the topics we have covered:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Semantic html introduces meaning to pages through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.</li>
                        <li>Semantic html is a modern standard and makes a website more accessible for people who use screenreaders to translate pages, boosting SEO.</li>
                        <li><strong>"header"</strong>, <strong>"nav"</strong>, <strong>"main"</strong>, and <strong>"footer"</strong> make up the basic structure of a webpage.</li>
                        <li><strong>"section"</strong> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.</li>
                        <li><strong>"article"</strong> holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>"aside"</strong> contains information that is related to the main content but not required in order to understand the dominant information.</li>
                        <li><strong>"figure"</strong> encapsulates all types of media.</li>
                        <li><strong>"figcaption"</strong> is used to describe all media in <strong>"figure"</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>video</strong>, <strong>"embed"</strong>, and <strong>"audio"</strong> elements are used for media files.</li>
