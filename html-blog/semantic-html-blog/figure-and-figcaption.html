                    <h2>Figure & Figcaption</h2>
                    <p>With <strong>aside</strong> we learned that we can put additional information next to a main peice of content,<br>
                    but what if we wanted to add info next to an image?</p>
                    <p>When adding captions or other media next to images, you'll find <strong>figure</strong> and <strong>figcaption</strong><br>
                    very useful.</p>
                    <p><strong>figure</strong> is an element used to encapsulate media such as images, illustrations, diagrams,<br>
                    and code snippets.</p>
                    <img src="/Users/snooget/snooget-web-dev/images-snooget/figure-in-action.png">
                    <p>In the code above, we created a <strong>figure</strong> element so that we can encapsulate our image tag.</p>
                    <p>It is also possible to add a caption to the image by using <strong>"figcaption"</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Figcaption</strong> is an element used to describe the media inside the figure tag. Usually<strong>figcaption</strong><br>
                    will go inside <strong>figure</strong> This is quite different than using a <strong>p</strong> element.</p>
                    <p>The difference helps when changing the location of <strong>figure</strong>, as a normal paragraph tag would get displaced.</p>
