        <h1>Intro to Semantic html</h1>
        <p>When building webpages we use a combination of semantic and non semamtic html. The words semantic stand for<br>
        meaningful.</p>
        <p>With semantic elements there is more information explaining the code in between the elements. Semantic html<br>
        uses elements based on their meaning. For example, div and span are used to divide lines of code but do not give<br>
        us any other information as to what the code inside of the tags mean.</p>
        <p>For example, we can use a "header" element to suggest that the information inside the code is part of the website head.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why use semantic html?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Semantic html makes webpages more accessible for mobile devices and disabled people.</li>
            <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Using semantic html makes website crawlers understand the format of your site, resulting in higher SEO ratings.</li>
            <li><strong>Makes Source Code Easy to Understand:</strong> Using semantic html makes it easy for you and other developers to read<br>
            the source code.</li>
        <p>Think of semantic html as labels in a store or shopping center. It just makes websites more clear.</p>
