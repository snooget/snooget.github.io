                    <h2>Type (CSS)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Remember that declarations are an important part of CSS since they apply a style to a selected element. However, how do we decide which elements will be styled?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the cases where we would like to specify which elements are to be styled we will use a selector. One selector we may already be familiar with is the type selector.
                        Much like the name suggests, the <em>type</em> selector mathces the <em>type</em> of the element  in the HTML document.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In previous lessons we changed the color of a paragraph element, and it looked much like this:
                    </p>

                        <img src="https://snooget.github.io/images-snooget/type-css-example-photo-1.png">
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        The code above has a clear example of the <em>type</em> selector in action. The element type here is <strong>"p"</strong> which comes from the HTML paragraph tag.
                        There are also a few important things to remember when using the <em>type</em> selector.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The type selector does not include the angle brackets.</li>
                        <li>Since element tags are often referred to by their opening tag name, the type selector is often referred to as the <em>tag name</em> or <em>element</em> selector.</li>
                    </ul>
