                         In the first row we have CSS applied as a ruleset. In the second row, we have the CSS written as an inline style. These two different styles have their pros and cons. They do seem quite<br>
                        hard to firgure out at first but are actually quite easy to break down.
                        </p>
                       
                        <p>
                        Taking a close look at the photo you can see that there are declarations in both rows, highlighted in pink. Declarations are at the core of CSS. Declarations serve to apply a style to the selected element.
                        In Codecademy's photo example, the <strong>p</strong> element has been selected to be displayed in blue.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Understanding the importance of declarations is important for learning how to style html documents with CSS. Below are some ruleset terms to know:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Selector</em>: Shown in yellow, is the beggining of the ruleset, and is used to target the element that will be styled.</li>
                            <li><em>Declaration Block</em>: This is the code in between the {} curly brackets that contain CSS declarations and give the html some life!</li>
                            <li><em>Declaration</em>: As covered above, is used to specify what you want to visually change in an element.</li>
                            <li><em>Property</em>: The declaration is split into two parts. The first part shows what visual characteristic the element is to be modified.</li>
                            <li><em>Value</em>: The second part of the declaration signifies the value of the property.</li>
                        </ul>
