                    <p>
                        As shown in the last lesson, using inline styles is not effective nor efficient. For example, lets say you wanted to style <stronh>h1</stronh> elements for your website. If you were using last lessons inline method you would have to add the CSS code to
                        the beginning tag of each element avery time a <strong>h1</strong> tag was inserted in the code. By using internal stylesheets, you can edit multiple or single html elements to your liking.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With internal stylesheets, you can be a smaller step ahead than the inline styling. Here is how it works. html allows for you to nest css in the <strong>header</strong> element. Keep in mind that a internal stylesheet, is still not the best way to add CSS to a website.
                        The best way will be with ruleset CSS which I will cover in a few more slides.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To create a stylesheet, we will use the <strong>style</strong> element which must be placed within the <strong>head</strong> element.
                    </p>
