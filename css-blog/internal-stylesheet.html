                    <p>
                        As shown in the last lesson, using inline styles is not effective nor efficient. For example, lets say you wanted to style <stronh>h1</stronh> elements for your website. If you were using last lessons inline method you would have to add the CSS code to
                        the beginning tag of each element every time a <strong>h1</strong> tag was inserted in the code. By using internal stylesheets, you can edit multiple or single html elements to your liking.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With internal stylesheets, you can be a smaller step ahead than the inline styling. Here is how it works. html allows for you to nest css in the <strong>header</strong> element. Keep in mind that a internal stylesheet, is still not the best way to add CSS to a website.
                        The best way will be with ruleset CSS which I will cover in a few more slides.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To create a stylesheet, we will use the <strong>style</strong> element which must be placed within the <strong>head</strong> element.
                    </p>

                    <figcaption>Example of *style* element</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    After adding opening and closing <strong>style</strong> tags in the head section, you can begin writing custom CSS code.
                </p>

                    <figcaption></figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The CSS code in the example above changes the color of all paragraph text to red and also changes the size of the text to 20 pixels.
                    Note how the syntax of the CSS code matches the syntax used for inline styling in the previous lesson. The only difference is that
                    you can specify which elements will be styled.
                </p>
